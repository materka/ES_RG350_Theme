---------------------------------------

Initially I didn't plan to share this theme, but since I was asked to do it I decided to publish it (even if it's not finished yet, because unfortunately I don't have time to continue it).

The version of Emulation Station I used is a bit old (but fully functional on RG350), so many functions have not been implemented.
The version of ES that I used: https://github.com/ManuelSch81/RG350-EmulationStation_configured

I hope someone can finish it, expand it and improve it.

---------------------------------------

At the moment there are very few systems supported by this theme. To understand how the theme works, there are two PSD template files in the /art folder: TEMP_System_In and TEMP_System_Out.
The structure is not properly optimized for time reasons (it could be a bit tricky).

SYSTEMS SUPPORTED:

Atari 2600
Atari 5200
NES
SNES
Game Boy
Game Boy Color
Game Boy Advance
PC Engine
Sega Master System
Sega Genesis
Sega 32X
Playstation

ARCADE:

Capcom Play System
Neo-Geo

All other systems are by default as in the Pixel theme.
